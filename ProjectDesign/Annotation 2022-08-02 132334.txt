-Download Android Studio
-Download OpenJDK
-Generate Key Store Command Line Command:
	keytool -keyalg RSA -genkeypair -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keystore debug.keystore -storepass android -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US" -validity 9999 -deststoretype pkcs12
-Lastly, this is the Android SDK path. This isn’t included in the video tutorial and I can’t find it in his

adding directory fixed the issue I’m having. Here's the directory: C:/Users/QHTF/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk
